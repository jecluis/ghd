# GitHub Dashboard

## Why

GitHub's interface doesn't allow for particularly good unified view of one's own
pull requests and issues, along side with those one is involved in, with
relevant information to each.

## What

We intend to address this, with the bonus of keeping a log of all things one has
been involved with, with statistics over time, desktop notifications, and who
knows what else.

## How

Relying on [Tauri][1], [Rust][2], and [Angular][3], we are implementing a
desktop application to present a GitHub dashboard for the user. We allow
tracking one's issues and pull requests, as well as others'.

We are very much in a development phase, and development doesn't happen as fast
as we would like. We are also figuring out what we want as we go, depending on
our workflow. Should you, the reader, have opinions, please do not hesitate in
sharing them with us by filing an [Issue][4].
